# Memoteca

Web application built with Angular to register, list, and organize thoughts. The project provides an interface to create, edit, favorite, and delete virtual sticky notes, as well as a mocked API powered by **JSON Server** that persists the data during development.

## Overview
- **Frontend**: Angular project located at [`memoteca/`](memoteca/) with a proxy configured to consume the local API.
- **Backend**: JSON Server located at [`memoteca/backend/`](memoteca/backend/) exposing the `/pensamentos` resource with pagination and filters.

## Features
- Create new thoughts with form validations.
- Paginated list with a "Load more" button.
- Text search by content or authorship.
- Edit and delete existing thoughts.
- Mark favorites and browse them in the dedicated "My Favorites" list.

## Technologies
- [Angular 14](https://angular.io/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/)
- [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (includes `npm`).
- Angular CLI installed globally (optional but recommended): `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

## How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gsoaresdz/memoteca.git
cd memoteca
```

### 2. Install dependencies
Install the frontend dependencies and then the mocked backend dependencies:
```bash
cd memoteca      # enter the Angular project
npm install      # install frontend dependencies
cd backend
npm install      # install JSON Server dependencies
```

> Tip: keep two terminals open or use background processes to run the frontend and backend simultaneously.

### 3. Start the backend (JSON Server)
Inside `memoteca/backend/` run:
```bash
npm start
```
The server will be available at `http://localhost:3000` with the `/pensamentos` endpoint defined in [`db.json`](memoteca/backend/db.json).

### 4. Start the frontend (Angular)
In another terminal (or after returning from `backend` with `cd ..`), inside `memoteca/` run:
```bash
npm start
```
The command runs `ng serve` with the [`proxy.conf.json`](memoteca/proxy.conf.json). The application will be available at `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Data structure
Each thought has the following fields:
| Field       | Type      | Description                                   |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `id`        | `number`  | Identifier generated by JSON Server.          |
| `conteudo`  | `string`  | Main text of the thought.                     |
| `autoria`   | `string`  | Author of the thought.                        |
| `modelo`    | `string`  | Visual variant of the card (e.g., `modelo1`). |
| `favorito`  | `boolean` | Indicates whether the thought is a favorite.  |

## Useful scripts
In the `memoteca/` directory:
- `npm start`: runs the development server with the configured proxy.
- `npm run build`: generates the production build in `dist/`.
- `npm test`: runs the unit tests via Karma.

In the `memoteca/backend/` directory:
- `npm start`: starts JSON Server watching `db.json`.
